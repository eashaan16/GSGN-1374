			<div class="q">
				<h2>What is the significance of communication in graphic design?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				<p>Communication is very crucial to graphic design as the entire point of design is to communicate with people. The primary objective of any design is to speak to its consumers effectively to convey messages and ideas. A graphic designer ensures that the consumer understands the objective of design effectively. Secondly, as a designer, communication across peers and teams is important so that all stakeholders can provide input in the creation of design and are aware of its development.</p>

			<div class="q">
				<h2>What should be a designer’s priority while creating a design?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				<p>I can't speak for all designers but I prioritize user engagement and content both. In my opinion, content has a major impact on consumers and without the consumer, there is no value of design. So I focus on creating designs with high-quality content that have the potential to gauge users.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="q">
				<h2>What are your strengths and weaknesses?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				<p>I’m a creative person driven by my passion for design. I’m proficient with graphic tools and have an artistic approach towards everything I create. I’m also a team player and know how to improve myself when given feedback. But my weakness is that I’m rather bad with time-management. I understand meeting deadlines is an important part of what I do, which is why I read a lot of time management books and try staying organized.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="q">
				<h2>Do you like working alone or with a team?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				<p>I have experience working both alone and with a team. I realised both have their own perks and challenges. I like working with a team better because it brings more creativity and helps keep a track of time.</p>
